# MT Exercise 3: Layer Normalization for Transformer Models

This repo is a collection of scripts showing how to install [JoeyNMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt), download
data and train & evaluate models, as well as the necessary data for training your own model

# Requirements

- This only works on a Unix-like system, with bash.
- Python 3.10 must be installed on your system, i.e. the command `python3` must be available
- Make sure virtualenv is installed on your system. To install, e.g.

    `pip install virtualenv`

# Steps for macOS & Linux users

Clone this repository or your fork thereof in the desired place:

    git clone https://github.com/marcamsler1/mt-exercise-03

Create a new virtualenv that uses Python 3. Please make sure to run this command outside of any virtual Python environment:

    ./scripts/make_virtualenv.sh

**Important**: Then activate the env by executing the `source` command that is output by the shell script above.

Make sure to install the exact software versions specified in the the exercise sheet before continuing.

Download Moses for post-processing:

    ./scripts/download_install_packages.sh


Train a model:

    ./scripts/train.sh

The training process can be interrupted at any time, and the best checkpoint will always be saved. It is also possible to continue training from there later on.

# Steps for Windows users

This repo relies on Bash scripts (.sh files), which do not run natively on Windows (CMD or PowerShell).  
Here are two ways to make it work:

Option 1: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Enable WSL and install Ubuntu: `wsl --install`

Open Ubuntu from your Start menu.

Inside the Ubuntu terminal, follow the exact same steps as shown above for macOS/Linux:
```
git clone https://github.com/marcamsler1/mt-exercise-03
cd mt-exercise-03
./scripts/make_virtualenv.sh
./scripts/download_install_packages.sh
./scripts/train.sh
```     

Option 2: Manually run steps without shell scripts
If you can't use WSL, you can recreate the process manually using PowerShell or CMD
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Manually download and install Moses and other dependencies (you'll need to look inside scripts/download_install_packages.sh to replicate its steps).

Run the training logic by manually executing the code inside train.sh, or porting it to a Python script or notebook.

# Pre-norm and Post-norm Transformers
Overview
In this exercise, two alternative Transformer architectures were compared using JoenyNMT: Pre-norm and Post-norm Transformer.
Both models were trained using the same hyperparameters as the provided baseline model. 

# Changes Made
Added configuration files
Created two new configuration files in configs/:

    deen_transformer_prenorm.yaml
    deen_transformer_postnorm.yaml

The configurations are based on the baseline model configuration.
The baseline model log file baseline.log was added separately in configs/ as well.

Layer normalization changes
The JoeyNMT Transformer implementation was modified to support two normalization strategies:

    layer_norm: "pre"
    layer_norm: "post"

These changes were implemented in the Transformer encoder and decoder layers.

Training
Both models were trained on the provided German-English dataset using identical hyperparameters, same tokenizer and vocabulary, same dataset split, same optimizer and learning rate.
Training was executed with:

    ./scripts/train.sh

The validation perplexity was evaluated every 500 steps.

The train.sh was modified to run it on the corresponding model:

    model_name=deen_transformer_...

# Results
The validation perplexities of the three models were compared:

 - Baseline
 - Prenorm
 - Postnorm

A line chart was created to visualize the training progress.

# Observation
 - The PreNorm model converged faster and achieved the lowest validation perplexities.
 - The PostNorm model improved more slowly and stabilized at higher perplexity values.
 - The results are consistent with Wang et al. (2019), which reported that PreNorm Transformers are easier to optimize and more stable during       training.
